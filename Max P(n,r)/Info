This consists of two codes based on two different approaches on finding max P(n,r) if you have to choose n and r from a given array.
The two different approaches can be:
      * Naive or bruteforce approach
      * Faster and innovative approach
      
      
      
Code is written such that you have to input the elements of the array and output will be the (n, r) pair for which P(n, r) is maximum.
